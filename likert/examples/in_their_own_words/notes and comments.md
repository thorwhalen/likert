In the following two tables we compare some statistics on the data collected during our study 
and the data collected during a previous study by different authors (NEED REFERENCE).


The following compare the differences between the proportions of respondents that NEVER use the term to designate themselves.

Below we display the data behind these comparison tables is (where p1 and n1 are respectively the proportion and sample size for our study, 
and p2 and n2 the same for the study we're comparing ourselves to). 
With these, the reader may verify the statistics above themselves (for example, using a proportion comparison calculator such as 
[this one](https://www.medcalc.org/calc/comparison_of_proportions.php))
